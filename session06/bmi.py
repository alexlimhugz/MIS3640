# 1. Create a BMI calculator using if/elif.

# BMI Categories:
# Underweight = <18.5
# Normal weight = 18.5–24.9
# Overweight = 25–29.9
# Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater
# 2. Assume that two variables, varA and varB, are assigned values, either numbers or strings. Write a piece of Python code that prints out one of the following messages:
# "string involved" if either varA or varB are strings
# "bigger" if varA is larger than varB
# "equal" if varA is equal to varB
# "smaller" if varA is smaller than varB

bmi = 703 * weight/height**2
 

    if weight =< 18.5:
    print("You're Underweight.")

    elif weight >= 18.5 and weight <= 24.9
    print("You're normal weight!")

    elif weight >= 25 and weight <= 29.9
    print("You're overweight.")
    else:
    print("You're obese.")
